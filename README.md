## Hangman game :
* Almost **1K words** available in both french and english !

## TODO :
* add real keyboard action
* display mystery word in red or green when victory or defeat !
* rename files with js only as .ts and not .tsx !
* useQuery to fetch data
* push on my github (after cleaning the README and adding a .gitignore)

## Further improvments :
* media phone format -> no height for heart container !
* don't access DOM elements with queries but rather with useRef...
* git branch to use FastAPI and fetch word only when restarting ! (really change the app -> new branch)
