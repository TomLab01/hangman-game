## Hangman game :
* Almost **1K words** available in both french and english !

## TODO :
* change app name
* add real keyboard action
* display mystery word in red or green when victory or defeat !
* change function on click with upstream () => ...
* useQuery ti fetch data
* push on my github (after cleaning the README and adding a .gitignore)
* track re-rendering with console.log in each component and try useMemo !

## Further improvments :
* media phone format -> no height for heart container !
* don't access DOM elements with queries but rather with useRef...
* git branch to use FastAPI and fetch word only when restarting ! (really change the app -> new branch)
